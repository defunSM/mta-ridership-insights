 This project analyzes various MTA datasets, including daily ridership, hourly subway usage, and train delays. The goal is to uncover insights into ridership patterns, peak hours, and operational delays to improve service efficiency and optimize resource allocation for the New York City transit system.

## Problem Statement

The New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) needs to optimize its services to better accommodate fluctuating ridership, improve operational efficiency, and reduce delays. Using datasets on daily and hourly ridership and train delays, this project seeks to identify patterns in passenger behavior and service disruptions. The insights will help inform decision-making for service improvements, resource allocation, and scheduling, ultimately enhancing the commuter experience and system reliability.

## Datasets

From the mta datasets explored, some of the most insightful ones for the MTA was:

1. **MTA Daily Ridership Data (2020+)**: This dataset provides daily ridership data across subways, buses, and railroads, essential for understanding post-pandemic recovery.
2. **MTA Subway Hourly Ridership (2022+)**: Useful for analyzing hourly passenger flow and fare payments across stations.
3. **Subway Train Delays (2020+)**: This dataset highlights causes and trends in train delays, helping to address operational inefficiencies.

These datasets can be found [here](https://data.ny.gov/browse?Dataset-Information_Agency=Metropolitan+Transportation+Authority&sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93).
